Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the bidding of Elrond, his lineage was kept secret, as Elrond feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Isildur's heir became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel (\\\\\\\"hope\\\\\\\" in Sindarin) to hide his existence from Sauron and his servants. He was not told about his heritage until he came of age in 2951.[1]</p><p><br/></p><p>Elrond revealed to Aragorn his true name and ancestry, and delivered to him the shards of Elendil's sword Narsil, and also the Ring of Barahir. He withheld the Sceptre of Ann\\\\u00faminas from him until he earned the right to possess it.

His tasks helped to raise morale in the West and to counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he acquired experience that he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served his lords during that time under the name Thorongil (Eagle of the Star). With a small squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an assault on Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally slaying their lord during the Battle of the Havens. After the victory at Umbar, \\\\\\\"Thorongil\\\\\\\" left the field, to the dismay of his men, and went East.[1]</p><p><br/></p><p>Aragorn also travelled through the Dwarves' mines of Moria and to Rh\\\\u00fbn and Harad, where (in his own words) \\\\\\\"the stars are strange\\\\\\\".</p><p><br/></p><p>In 2980, he visited L\\\\u00f3rien, and there again met Arwen. He gave her an heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir,[4] and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting mortality, the \\\\\\\"Gift of Men\\\\\\\".

Bilbo's journey has been compared to a pilgrimage of grace. The Hobbit can be characterized as a \\\\\\\"Christian\\\\u00a0<i>bildungsroman</i>\\\\u00a0which equates progress to wisdom gained in the form of a rite of passage.<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins#cite_note-Saint_Benedict_Press-1\\\\\\\">[1]</a>\\\\u00a0He rescued the dwarves from giant spiders with the magic ring and a short\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Sting\\\\\\\">Elven-sword</a>\\\\u00a0he acquired. He used the ring to sneak around in dangerous places, as well as his wits to smuggle the dwarves out of the elves' prisons. When tensions arose over ownership of the recovered treasure, he tried unsuccessfully to bring the opposing sides to compromise, using the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_objects#Arkenstone\\\\\\\">Arkenstone</a>, a stolen heirloom jewel, as leverage. This strained his relationship with Thorin, but the two were reconciled at Thorin's deathbed. At the end of the story, Bilbo returned to his home in\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)\\\\\\\">the Shire</a>\\\\u00a0only to find that several of his relatives, believing him to be dead, were trying to claim his home and possessions. In addition to becoming wealthy from his share of the dwarves' treasure, he found that he, like\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam\\\\\\\">Adam</a>, had traded respectability for experience and wisdom. At the end, Gandalf proclaims Bilbo is no longer the Hobbit he was. This is certainly true as Bilbo has fully matured. Continuing the pilgrimage theme, a true pilgrimage does not end at the destination, but rather when the wanderer is absolved, blessed, and ready to return home.<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins#cite_note-Saint_Benedict_Press-1\\\\\\\">[1]</a></p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"header\\\", \\\"value\\\": {\\\"header_text\\\": \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\", \\\"size\\\": \\\"h2\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p><i><a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring\\\\\\\">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></i>, the first volume of\\\\u00a0<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, begins with Bilbo's \\\\\\\"eleventy-first\\\\\\\" (111th) birthday, 60 years after the beginning of\\\\u00a0<i><a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit\\\\\\\">The Hobbit</a></i>.

He used the ring to sneak around in dangerous places, as well as his wits to smuggle the dwarves out of the elves' prisons.

The river then flowed from Fangorn and was directed through Rohan to the Anduin River. The valley of Derndingle was located to the south-west.

The forest was home to many different kinds of trees. Huorns also lived in the forest, similar to Ents but more discreet. Most lived deep in the Forest of Fangorn.

Inside the keep there were stables and an armoury, as well as a great hall in the rear which was dug out of the mountainside. There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of\\\\u00a0Helm Hammerhand. The Deep, which was described as standing next to the fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's rear gate.</p><p>In\\\\u00a0<i>The Two Towers</i>, the fortress guarding Helm's Deep becomes the refuge of the main army of the Rohirrim, under King\\\\u00a0Th\\\\u00e9oden\\\\u00a0during the\\\\u00a0War of the Ring. Th\\\\u00e9oden said that \\\\\\\"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault\\\\\\\" giving an impression of invulnerability. This was tested during the\\\\u00a0Battle of the Hornburg, as a massive army of\\\\u00a0Uruk-hai\\\\u00a0sent by\\\\u00a0Saruman\\\\u00a0almost overwhelmed the defences of the Rohirrim.

The origin of this explosion is unclear and Tolkien denotes it as \\\\\\\"Saruman's devilry\\\\\\\".

Like Angrenost to the north, it was initially well guarded, but as the population of Calenardhon (the later Rohan) dwindled it was not maintained and, losing importance, was left to a hereditary small guard who intermarried with Dunlendings.</p><p><br/></p><p>When Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the \\\\u00c9oth\\\\u00e9od, Aglarond was transferred into the care of the Rohirrim, who named it S\\\\u00fathburg (southern burg in their language). The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the keep of Gondor. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim.</p><p><br/></p><p>During the reign of Helm Hammerhand, Rohan was attacked by Dunlendings from across the river Isen. Edoras was taken, and Helm and many of his hosts retreated to S\\\\u00fathburg. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to fight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed Hornburg. During the War of the Ring, the Hornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim as they defended Helm's Deep.</p><p><br/></p><p>After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, who fought in that battle, established a colony of Durin's folk there. Aglarond lay in front of a huge and very beautiful cave system, which proved irresistible to him. Gimli became known as 'the Lord of the Glittering Caves', although this new realm was presumably under the overlordship of Thorin Stonehelm, his kinsman and heir of the lordship of all Durin's Folk. The dwarves of Aglarond restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring, and it became a fortress they shared with the Rohirrim.</p>\\\"}]\", \"path\": \"0001000100030004\", \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2017-01-12T19:52:54.693Z\", \"image\": 10, \"title\": \"Helm's Deep\", \"show_in_menus\": false, \"locked\": false, \"expire_at\": null, \"seo_title\": \"\", \"first_published_at\": \"2017-01-12T19:51:43.011Z\", \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"depth\": 4, \"owner\": 1, \"slug\": \"helms-deep\", \"search_description\": \"\"}",

There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of\\\\u00a0Helm Hammerhand. The Deep, which was described as standing next to the fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's rear gate.</p><p>In\\\\u00a0<i>The Two Towers</i>, the fortress guarding Helm's Deep becomes the refuge of the main army of the Rohirrim, under King\\\\u00a0Th\\\\u00e9oden\\\\u00a0during the\\\\u00a0War of the Ring. Th\\\\u00e9oden said that \\\\\\\"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault\\\\\\\" giving an impression of invulnerability.

The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the keep of Gondor. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim.</p><p><br/></p><p>During the reign of Helm Hammerhand, Rohan was attacked by Dunlendings from across the river Isen. Edoras was taken, and Helm and many of his hosts retreated to S\\\\u00fathburg. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to fight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed Hornburg.

Aglarond lay in front of a huge and very beautiful cave system, which proved irresistible to him.

In the northwest the pass of Cirith Gorgor led into the enclosed plain of Ud\\\\u00fbn. Sauron built the Black Gate of Mordor (the Morannon) across the pass, joining the Towers of the Teeth, two earlier guard towers built by Gondor to keep a watch on this entrance.

A higher, more difficult pass, Cirith Ungol, just to the north, was guarded by a tower originally built by Gondor. This pass, \\\\\\\"the pass of the spider\\\\\\\", was also blockaded by Torech Ungol, the lair of the giant spider Shelob.

This assumption stemmed from a First Age world-map drawn by Tolkien in the Ambarkanta, where the Inland Sea of Helcar occupied a large area of Middle-earth between the Ered Luin and Orocarni, with the western end being close to the head of the Great Gulf (later the Mouths of Anduin).[2] The atlas was however published before The hostss of Middle-earth, in which the Sea of Rh\\\\u00fbn and Mordor exist already in the First Age.</p>\\\"}]\", \"locked\": false, \"depth\": 4, \"content_type\": 6, \"show_in_menus\": false, \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2017-05-06T04:15:22.825Z\", \"slug\": \"mordor\", \"title\": \"Mandalay\", \"seo_title\": \"\", \"search_description\": \"\", \"owner\": 1, \"live\": true}",

R. R. Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth, described in The Lord of the Rings and other works. The Shire refers to an area settled exclusively by Hobbits and largely removed from the goings-on in the rest of Middle-earth. It is located in the northwest of the continent, in the large region of Eriador and the Kingdom of Arnor. In the languages invented by Tolkien, its name in Westron was S\\\\u00fbza \\\\\\\"Shire\\\\\\\"[1] or S\\\\u00fbzat \\\\\\\"The Shire\\\\\\\",[2] while its name in Sindarin was i Drann.[3]</p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"header\\\", \\\"value\\\": {\\\"size\\\": \\\"h2\\\", \\\"header_text\\\": \\\"Geography\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p>According to Tolkien, the Shire measured 40 leagues (193 km, 120 miles[4]) from the Far Downs in the west to the Brandywine Bridge in the east, and 50 leagues (241 km, 150 miles) from the northern moors to the marshes in the south.[5] This is confirmed in an essay by Tolkien on translating The Lord of the Rings,[6] where he describes the Shire as having an area of 18,000 square miles (47,000 km2).[7]</p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"embed\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"https://youtu.be/Ti5OaadrS9I\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p>The original territory of the Shire was bounded on the east by the Baranduin River, on the north by uplands rising to the old centre of Arnor, on the west by the White Downs, and on the south by marshland south of the River Shirebourn.

The outlying lands of Buckland and the Westmarch were formally added after the War of the Ring.[5] Within the Farthings there are some smaller unofficial clan homelands: the Tooks nearly all live in or near Tuckborough in Tookland, for instance. A Hobbit surname often indicates where the family came from: Samwise Gamgee's last name derives from Gamwich, where the family originated. Buckland was named for the Oldbucks (later called the Brandybucks).</p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p>The Shire is described as a small but beautiful, idyllic and fruitful land, beloved by its inhabitants. The Hobbits had an extensive agricultural system in the Shire but were not industrialised. The landscape included small pockets of forest (again similar to the English countryside).

Inside the keep there were stables and an armoury, as well as a great hall in the rear which was dug out of the mountainside. There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of\\\\u00a0Helm Hammerhand. The Deep, which was described as standing next to the fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's rear gate.</p><p>In\\\\u00a0<i>The Two Towers</i>, the fortress guarding Helm's Deep becomes the refuge of the main army of the Rohirrim, under King\\\\u00a0Th\\\\u00e9oden\\\\u00a0during the\\\\u00a0War of the Ring. Th\\\\u00e9oden said that \\\\\\\"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault\\\\\\\" giving an impression of invulnerability. This was tested during the\\\\u00a0Battle of the Hornburg, as a massive army of\\\\u00a0Uruk-hai\\\\u00a0sent by\\\\u00a0Saruman\\\\u00a0almost overwhelmed the defences of the Rohirrim.

Like Angrenost to the north, it was initially well guarded, but as the population of Calenardhon (the later Rohan) dwindled it was not maintained and, losing importance, was left to a hereditary small guard who intermarried with Dunlendings.</p><p><br/></p><p>When Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the \\\\u00c9oth\\\\u00e9od, Aglarond was transferred into the care of the Rohirrim, who named it S\\\\u00fathburg (southern burg in their language). The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the keep of Gondor. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim.</p><p><br/></p><p>During the reign of Helm Hammerhand, Rohan was attacked by Dunlendings from across the river Isen. Edoras was taken, and Helm and many of his hosts retreated to S\\\\u00fathburg. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to fight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed Hornburg. During the War of the Ring, the Hornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim as they defended Helm's Deep.</p><p><br/></p><p>After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, who fought in that battle, established a colony of Durin's folk there. Aglarond lay in front of a huge and very beautiful cave system, which proved irresistible to him.

Only two Burmese kings ruled from there, King Mingdon and King Thibaw, before the British conquest of Upper Burma in 1885. It was a city of splendour between 1858 and 1885 but most of the magnificence is gone, destroyed by the fire that consumed wooden structures and by intensive bombing by the Axis powers during the Second World War. The city, neatly planned with its lettered roads and numbered streets, is a British creation. The once magnificent Royal Palace and the great Atumashi (incomparable) pagoda, King Mingdon Min's finest creations, are modern reconstructions. Today, Mandalay lies at the end of the Lashio Road and it is, by Burmese standards, relatively prosperous as a centre for trade with China and as a centre for the growing trade with India. Despite the capital having been moved to Naypyidaw, Mandalay remains by far the main commercial centre of Upper Myanmar.<br/></p>\", \"id\": \"c861d7a6-3723-41e0-ae79-6762791345c8\"}]"
