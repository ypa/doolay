Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the bidding of Elrond, his lineage was kept secret, as Elrond feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as Isildur's heir became known.

His tasks helped to raise morale in the West and to counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he acquired experience that he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served his lords during that time under the name Thorongil (Eagle of the Star). With a small squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an assault on Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally slaying their lord during the Battle of the Havens.

Elrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such time as his foster son should be king of Gondor and Arnor reunited.

Bilbo's journey has been compared to a pilgrimage of grace. The Hobbit can be characterized as a \\\\\\\"Christian\\\\u00a0<i>bildungsroman</i>\\\\u00a0which equates progress to wisdom gained in the form of a rite of passage.<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins#cite_note-Saint_Benedict_Press-1\\\\\\\">[1]</a>\\\\u00a0He rescued the dwarves from giant spiders with the magic ring and a short\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Sting\\\\\\\">Elven-sword</a>\\\\u00a0he acquired. He used the ring to sneak around in dangerous places, as well as his wits to smuggle the dwarves out of the elves' prisons. When tensions arose over ownership of the recovered treasure, he tried unsuccessfully to bring the opposing sides to compromise, using the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_objects#Arkenstone\\\\\\\">Arkenstone</a>, a stolen heirloom jewel, as leverage. This strained his relationship with Thorin, but the two were reconciled at Thorin's deathbed. At the end of the story, Bilbo returned to his home in\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)\\\\\\\">the Shire</a>\\\\u00a0only to find that several of his relatives, believing him to be dead, were trying to claim his home and possessions. In addition to becoming wealthy from his share of the dwarves' treasure, he found that he, like\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam\\\\\\\">Adam</a>, had traded respectability for experience and wisdom. At the end, Gandalf proclaims Bilbo is no longer the Hobbit he was. This is certainly true as Bilbo has fully matured. Continuing the pilgrimage theme, a true pilgrimage does not end at the destination, but rather when the wanderer is absolved, blessed, and ready to return home.<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins#cite_note-Saint_Benedict_Press-1\\\\\\\">[1]</a></p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"header\\\", \\\"value\\\": {\\\"header_text\\\": \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\", \\\"size\\\": \\\"h2\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p><i><a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring\\\\\\\">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></i>, the first volume of\\\\u00a0<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, begins with Bilbo's \\\\\\\"eleventy-first\\\\\\\" (111th) birthday, 60 years after the beginning of\\\\u00a0<i><a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit\\\\\\\">The Hobbit</a></i>.

Inside the keep there were stables and an armoury, as well as a great hall in the rear which was dug out of the mountainside. There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of\\\\u00a0Helm Hammerhand. The Deep, which was described as standing next to the fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's rear gate.</p><p>In\\\\u00a0<i>The Two Towers</i>, the fortress guarding Helm's Deep becomes the refuge of the main army of the Rohirrim, under King\\\\u00a0Th\\\\u00e9oden\\\\u00a0during the\\\\u00a0War of the Ring. Th\\\\u00e9oden said that \\\\\\\"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault\\\\\\\" giving an impression of invulnerability. This was tested during the\\\\u00a0Battle of the Hornburg, as a massive army of\\\\u00a0Uruk-hai\\\\u00a0sent by\\\\u00a0Saruman\\\\u00a0almost overwhelmed the defences of the Rohirrim. Saruman's\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)\\\\\\\">orcs</a>\\\\u00a0used an explosive blast of fire within the culvert which, when detonated, breached the long Deeping Wall. The origin of this explosion is unclear and Tolkien denotes it as \\\\\\\"Saruman's devilry\\\\\\\". The Rohirrim defenders held out long enough in the fortress until dawn, giving Gandalf time to gather and lead a counter-attack, while Th\\\\u00e9oden led a cavalry charge that drove the Orcs from the fortress.</p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"image\\\", \\\"value\\\": {\\\"caption\\\": \\\"Crest of Gondor, the original builders of the Helm\\\", \\\"style\\\": \\\"half\\\", \\\"image\\\": 9}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"header\\\", \\\"value\\\": {\\\"header_text\\\": \\\"Aglarond\\\", \\\"size\\\": \\\"h2\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p>Aglarond and Angrenost (which later became Isengard) were the two fortresses built by Gondor to guard the approaches to the Fords of Isen. Like Angrenost to the north, it was initially well guarded, but as the population of Calenardhon (the later Rohan) dwindled it was not maintained and, losing importance, was left to a hereditary small guard who intermarried with Dunlendings.</p><p><br/></p><p>When Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the \\\\u00c9oth\\\\u00e9od, Aglarond was transferred into the care of the Rohirrim, who named it S\\\\u00fathburg (southern burg in their language). The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the keep of Gondor. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim.</p><p><br/></p><p>During the reign of Helm Hammerhand, Rohan was attacked by Dunlendings from across the river Isen. Edoras was taken, and Helm and many of his people retreated to S\\\\u00fathburg. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to fight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed Hornburg. During the War of the Ring, the Hornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim as they defended Helm's Deep.</p><p><br/></p><p>After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, who fought in that battle, established a colony of Durin's folk there. Aglarond lay in front of a huge and very beautiful cave system, which proved irresistible to him. Gimli became known as 'the Lord of the Glittering Caves', although this new realm was presumably under the overlordship of Thorin Stonehelm, his kinsman and heir of the lordship of all Durin's Folk. The dwarves of Aglarond restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring, and it became a fortress they shared with the Rohirrim.</p>\\\"}]\", \"path\": \"0001000100030004\", \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2017-01-12T19:52:54.693Z\", \"image\": 10, \"title\": \"Helm's Deep\", \"show_in_menus\": false, \"locked\": false, \"expire_at\": null, \"seo_title\": \"\", \"first_published_at\": \"2017-01-12T19:51:43.011Z\", \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"depth\": 4, \"owner\": 1, \"slug\": \"helms-deep\", \"search_description\": \"\"}",

The fortress Durthang lay in the northern Ephel D\\\\u00faath above Ud\\\\u00fbn.</p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"embed\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"https://youtu.be/jk9wwlzuwJE\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p>N\\\\u00farn, the southern part of Mordor, was less arid and more fertile. Streams here fed the salt Sea of N\\\\u00farnen. Sauron's slaves farmed this region to support his armies.</p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p>Inside the Ephel D\\\\u00faath ran a lower parallel ridge, the Morgai, separated from the Ephel D\\\\u00faath by a narrow valley that Frodo and Sam followed northward after escaping from Cirith Ungol. Water trickled into this vale from the Ephel D\\\\u00faath, and the text describes it as a \\\\\\\"dying land not yet dead\\\\\\\". The vegetation included \\\\\\\"low scrubby trees\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"coarse grey grass-tussocks\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"withered mosses\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"great writhing, tangled brambles\\\\\\\", and thickets of briars with long, stabbing thorns.

This assumption stemmed from a First Age world-map drawn by Tolkien in the Ambarkanta, where the Inland Sea of Helcar occupied a large area of Middle-earth between the Ered Luin and Orocarni, with the western end being close to the head of the Great Gulf (later the Mouths of Anduin).[2] The atlas was however published before The Peoples of Middle-earth, in which the Sea of Rh\\\\u00fbn and Mordor exist already in the First Age.</p>\\\"}]\", \"path\": \"0001000100030001\", \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2017-01-12T20:23:50.810Z\", \"image\": 5, \"title\": \"Mordor\", \"show_in_menus\": false, \"locked\": false, \"expire_at\": null, \"seo_title\": \"\", \"first_published_at\": \"2016-10-24T15:19:13.969Z\", \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"depth\": 4, \"owner\": 1, \"slug\": \"mordor\", \"search_description\": \"\"}",
