There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of\\\\u00a0Helm Hammerhand. The Deep, which was described as standing next to the fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's rear gate.</p><p>In\\\\u00a0<i>The Two Towers</i>, the fortress guarding Helm's Deep becomes the refuge of the main army of the Rohirrim, under King\\\\u00a0Th\\\\u00e9oden\\\\u00a0during the\\\\u00a0War of the Ring.

If you baulk at the high fare, the taxi drivers will attempt to gather other travelers to share the taxi and split the fare, so there is a good chance you will end up paying a lot less by sharing your taxi. By comparison a taxi from Yangon airport to the city centre (45 min.) is just 8000 Kyats or 7 USD. A possible way to save money is to book a taxi in advance with your guesthouse, but seems like now they all charge the same 25,000 kyat fixed price. 15,000kyat is a good price to/from the airport that may be more difficult to reserve on your way in, but no issue to book for your return trip to Heho from any agency in town. When returning, you can often save by booking a shared taxi through your hotel or one of the many travel agents around. Check with them the day before you fly out.</p>\\"}, {\\"type\\": \\"paragraph\\", \\"value\\": \\"<p>Prices for flights are around US$110 from Yangon and US$75 from Mandalay, but unlike bus companies the government is heavily involved in the domestic air market, a good chunk of your money will be going into their hands.</p>\\"}]", "expire_at": null, "has_unpublished_changes": false, "latest_revision_created_at": "2018-01-26T04:04:25.266Z", "owner": 1, "pk": 12, "url_path": "/homepage/places/inle/", "locked": false}	\N	12	1
