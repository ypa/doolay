Hi Ma Wynee,

It's been a while. I wanted to do this project and got busy with my job. My apologies.

Thanks for sending those pictures and the example tours. 
I have setup your [Host page](http://demo.doolay.com/hosts/wynee/) and [experience page](http://demo.doolay.com/experiences/yangon-sightseeing-tour/) on my demo/example site. The experience page I listed on that example site is derived from your pictures you sent me. I made it only for Yangon tour. Please let me know if they look ok to you. Please note that they're only for example right now. The actual site will be up and running soon. I'm working on 'booking' functionality right now. 

Also do you know anyone else that would be interested in listing on the site. Please let me know.
I'm also looking to hire someone who could coordinate these tours between the tour guide and the tourists. If you know someone that could do that please let me know. They don't need to be tour guides themselves, but someone who could hussle and coordinte with the tourists and tour guides. I'd like to chat with you on Skype again when you have some time.

Please let me know when would be a good time.

Thanks,
Yan Pyay
